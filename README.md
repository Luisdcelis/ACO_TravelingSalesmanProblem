# ACO to Traveling Salesman Problem

Ant colony optimization is a technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through Graphs which is perfect to solve the traveling salesman problem (that tries to find the minimun through all the cities).

Also, you can find in the carpet TSPLIB some instances of this problem.
